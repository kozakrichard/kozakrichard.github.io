<p>Eleanor was born in 1822, and was said to be <blockquote cite= "www.shawtys.com">
Bad as hell ever since her late teens. By the time she was 21, she was certifiably one of 
the biggest cuties in Denmark. This was high praise, coming from King Arthur, who claimed 
to have the highest density of cuties in his capitol city, Denmark Jr. <abbr title="Denmark Junior
City">DMJ</abbr> had so many cuties
in fact, that in 1844, a pageant was held to ELIMINATE half of the cutie population. Starvation and cannibalism
was wreaking havoc on Denmark Jr. The legend says that Eleanor murdered four separate women in order to 
maintain her hierarchy in the capitol.
